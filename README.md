#  AutoSortBin: An IoT and Deep Learning Based Smart Waste Segregation System

AutoSortBin is a smart bin system combining **IoT**, **Computer Vision**, and **Cloud Monitoring** to automatically segregate waste into six categories: **Paper, Glass, Metal, Plastic, Organic, and E-Waste**. It uses a custom-trained **DenseNet-121 CNN model**, an **ESP32-based simulated circuit on Wokwi**, and **ThingSpeak** for real-time monitoring and bin-full alerts.

 This work was presented in the research paper:  
**_"AutoSortBin: Integrating CPS and IoT with Densely Connected Convolutional Networks for Sustainable Waste Management"_**

##  Features

-  **Deep Learning Classification**  
  - DenseNet-121 used for high-accuracy waste classification  
  - 976 custom-labeled images across 6 classes: Paper, Glass, Metal, Plastic, Organic, E-Waste  

-  **IoT Cloud Monitoring**  
  - Live status updates on bin fullness using ThingSpeak  
  - Automatic updates of bin levels and type detection  

-  **Smart Automation**  
  - Servo motors open the correct bin lid based on classification  
  - LCD shows the detected waste type and status  

-  **Wokwi Simulation**  
  - Complete ESP32 circuit simulated with ultrasonic sensors, LCD, and servo motors  

-  **Bin Full Alerts**  
  - If a bin is full (detected via ultrasonic sensors), the lid won’t open  
  - Alert sent to ThingSpeak with timestamp

##  Installation & Setup

###  Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avin-Chaudhary/AutoSortBin.git
cd AutoSortBin
```

###  Install Model Dependencies

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pillow matplotlib opencv-python
```

###  Circuit Simulation on Wokwi

1. Open [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/)
2. Upload files from the `wokwi-circuit/` folder
3. Use `diagram.json` to connect: **ESP32 + Servo + LCD + Ultrasonic Sensor**

###  ThingSpeak Setup

1. Sign up on [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com)
2. Create a new channel and generate your **Write API Key**
3. Replace the key in the file `thingspeak-code/esp32-thingspeak.ino`

---

##  How to Run

1. Power the system (hardware or Wokwi simulation)  
2. Place waste object in front of the camera  
3. Image is classified using the trained CNN model  
4. Corresponding bin lid opens automatically via servo  
5. LCD displays the detected category  
6. If bin is full → lid stays shut & alert is sent  
7. ThingSpeak dashboard updates with latest data

##  Future Scope

- GSM module for SMS alerts  
- Advanced sensors (moisture, IR, odor) for better detection  
- Solar-powered design with backup battery  
- Full hardware prototype with enclosure  
- Cloud analytics using Firebase or Google Cloud
